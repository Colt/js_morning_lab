##JS Control flow
Create the following files and use looping structures we learned in class to solve the problems.

After that work on the questions on google_shopping.js

##reverse.js
Write a program that will take a hardcoded string, and console log the reversed version of it. Use a `for` loop

`var inputString = "building"`

##filterLongWords.js
Hardcode an array of words. Have a variable maxLength, push words that are less than the maxLength into a new array, and console.log that.


##pluralizer.js
Take an input like

```
thing = "cat"
count = "5"
```
and output the pluralized form of the word like "5 cats" or "1 dog"...
